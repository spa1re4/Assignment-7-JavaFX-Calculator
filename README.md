# Assignment-7-JavaFX-Calculator
This project is a simple calculator built using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Java to handle arithmetic operations.

Main Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The calculator interface includes a text field to display the current input and result.
Buttons for number input (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), a decimal point (.), and buttons to calculate the result (=) and clear the input (AC).
Controller:

The HelloController class manages interactions between the user and the interface.
When number buttons are pressed, the corresponding number is added to the text field.
When an arithmetic operation (e.g., +) is selected, the first number is saved, and the user is prompted to enter a second number.
Pressing the = button performs the calculation and displays the result.
If an invalid operation is performed, such as division by zero, the calculator displays "ERROR."
The "AC" button resets the input for a new calculation.
calculator Class:

The calculator class handles the logic for performing arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It takes two numbers (operands) and an operator (the arithmetic action) to perform calculations.
If an error occurs (e.g., division by zero), the calculator returns an error message.
Technologies Used:
Java: The main language used to build the application.
JavaFX: The framework for creating the graphical interface.
FXML: Used for designing the layout of the calculator (if applicable).
How the Calculator Works:
Use the number buttons to input numbers.
Press an arithmetic operation button (+, -, *, /).
Enter the second number.
Press = to calculate the result.
The "AC" button resets the display for a new calculation.
